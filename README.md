# CollegeBuddy
I developed a Python application for high school seniors to research universities and plan their application strategy, with a recommendation engine component to find schools that match a user's preferences. This application includes an essay editing platform using a File I/O system to store, retrieve and manipulate essay drafts. I used a TKinter GUI as well as selenium webdriving to scrape, collect and display relevant college data from internet.
Uses CMU 112 Graphics Library, a subset of the TKinter Graphics Library
